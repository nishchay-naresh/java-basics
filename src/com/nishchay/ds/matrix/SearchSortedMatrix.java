/*
 *	=========== Search element in a sorted matrix ===========
 *
 * Given a sorted matrix mat[n][m](non square) and an element ‘x’. Find the position of x in the matrix if it is present, else print -1.
 * Matrix is sorted in a way such that all elements in a row are sorted in increasing order
 * Such that for row ‘i’, where 1 <= i <= n-1, the first element of row ‘i’ is greater than or equal to the last element of row ‘i-1’.
 *
 * ie each row elements are sorted in asc order
 * and last element of ith row <= first element of i+1th row
 *
 *	We are given a 2D array where all elements in any individual row or column are sorted.
 * 	In such a matrix, we have to search or find the position of, a given key.
 *
 *	For Example
 *		Input : mat[][] = { {1, 5, 9},
 *		                    {14, 20, 21},
 *		                    {30, 34, 43} }
 *		        x = 14
 *		Output : Found at (1, 0)
 *
 *		Input : mat[][] = { {1, 5, 9, 11},
 *		                    {14, 20, 21, 26},
 *		                    {30, 34, 43, 50} }
 *		        x = 42
 *		Output : -1

     * A Simple Solution is to one by one compare x with every element of the matrix, time complexity of this solution is O(n x m).

     *
     * However, there are better solutions with less time complexity that use the sorted property of matrix.
     *
     *  We start from the upper right corner of the matrix and compare its value with the key.

     *      return (i,j)

     *      we move one position to the left.
     *  If matrix[i][j] <  key
