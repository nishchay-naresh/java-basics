/*
 *	=========== Design a stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space ===========
 *
 *	Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull()
 *  and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack.
 *  All these operations of SpecialStack must be O(1) time and O(1) extra space.
 *
 *
 *	Example 1:
 *		Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 *		Output: [5,6]
 *
 *	Example 2:
 *		Input: nums = [1,1]
 *		Output: [2]
