 *	=========== Fisher–Yates shuffle Algorithm ===========
 *
 * Picks up a random song from the playlist and plays it.
 *
 * There is a audio player given which picks up a random song from the playlist and plays it.
 * The song should not be repeated until all songs are played atleast once.The sequence number of the songs are given in an array.
 * Design such audio player without using any extra space.
 *
 *
 *========================
 * Given an array, write a program to generate a random permutation of array elements.
 * This question is also asked as “shuffle a deck of cards” or “randomize a given array”.
 * Here shuffle means that every permutation of array element should equally likely.
