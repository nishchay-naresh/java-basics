 *###################Lucky Number####################
 *
 *	The sequence of natural numbers or subset of integers that we get after removing second, third, fourth, fifth, and so on
 *  number respectively from the sequence.
 *  By applying the process there still remains some numbers indefinitely in the sequence such numbers are known as lucky numbers.
 *
 *
 *	Examples :
 *
 *		1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, ….
 *		Let's remove every second number (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ……) from the above sequence, we get:
 *		1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25,
 *		Let's remove every third number (5, 11, 17, 23, ……) from the above sequence, we get:
 *		1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25
 *      remove every fourth number
 *      1, 3, 7, 13, 15, 19, 25
 *      remove every fifth number
 *      1, 3, 7, 13, 19, 25
