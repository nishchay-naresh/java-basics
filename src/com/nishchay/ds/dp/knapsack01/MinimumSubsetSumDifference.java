/*
 *	Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum
 *
 *	Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
 *	If there is a set S with n elements,
 *	 then if we assume Subset1 has m elements,
 *	 Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
 *
 *	Example:
 *
 *	Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5}
 *	Output: 1
 *	Explanation:
 *	Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
 *	Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
