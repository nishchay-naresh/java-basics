/*
*  we can easily leverage the multi-threading benefits by enabling/disabling a switch in same piece of code
*
*  switch - .stream() / .parallelStream()
*  and performance difference is also very significance
*
*  -> imperative style the structure of sequential code is very different from the structure of concurrent code
*  -> using streams the structure of sequential code is identical to the structure of concurrent code
*
* mutability and parallel don't go together, you canâ€™t mix them
* sometimes we end of getting wrong result bcus of this mutability
*
*
* Streams			:	sequential vs parallel
* Reactive Stream	:	sync vs. async
*
* Reactive Stream -  have 3 states , data, error, completed
* similarly it also have 3 channel : data, error, completed channel
*
* Promises vs Reactive Stream :
* Promises -  it is for 0/1 data
* Reactive Stream - it is series of data, so for 0/1/many data
