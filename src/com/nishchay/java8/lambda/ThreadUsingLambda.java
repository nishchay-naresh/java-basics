* In java method is the 2nd class citizen, A method can't exist as independent, it must be wrapped around an Object
*
* 1. anonymous inner class - We are passing the behaviour, by wrapping it under a class
* 2. lambda expression - passing the behaviour as en independent entity, which has been pointed by lambda
