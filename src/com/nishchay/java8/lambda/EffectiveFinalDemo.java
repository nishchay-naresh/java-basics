/*
* Also referred as closure in lambda
* Effective Final -  concept introduced in java8. in earlier version you need to make y as final to achieve this
* java compiler keeping a watch on y, if user changes it, compiler will flag compiler time error
* Have same behaviour for both lambda & anonymous inner class
*
* A variable is effectively final if:
*  - It is assigned only once.
*  - Its value never changes after the initial assignment.

     * ======== Key Concepts =========
     *		Concept						Explanation
     *	Effectively final		Lambda captures variables that don't change â€” but arrays/objects can be changed without changing their reference.
     *	Mutable state			factor[0] is mutable. The lambda sees the latest value during execution.
     *	Stream laziness			The stream pipeline does nothing until the terminal operation (forEach) is invoked.
     * 	Side effects			Changing shared mutable state (factor[0]) before running the stream can lead to unpredictable results or bugs.
